# Hallelujah Mountains for Minetest

AKA Cloudlands — giant rocks floating suspended in magnetic eddies.

This can be run with or without a normal terrain mapgen, allowing pure skylands or an exotic addition to the landscape.

Configurable settings include the altitude islands appear, and the ability to restrict the areas they spawn.

It's a single file with no hard dependencies for easy integration into modpacks or games, e.g. as an exotic biome. 

Hallelujah Mountains [maps](https://i.imgur.com/2SkoAyB.png) can be generated by [Amidstest](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=19869), provided you know the seed of the world. The islands are not homogenous — there will be areas without any, while smaller islands tend to follow eddy fields, often emanating out from much larger and rarer islands.

**Mod dependencies:** None. 

**Minetest version:** v5.0+

**Recommended mods:**
* Vines, or something that contains vines, such as plantlife_modpack or MineClone2. These will grow off the sides of the islands, climate permitting, allowing you to climb, and looking picturesque!
* Extra ways to explore
    * [Bridger](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=18243) or [Bridges](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=3488) if you want to build nice wooden bridges between islands
    * [Airboat](https://github.com/paramat/airboat) to sail the high clouds on a small airship
    * [Flying carpet](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=12263)
    * [Jetpack, wings, etc.](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=11257)
    * Teleporter mods, balloon mods, etc.
