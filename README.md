# Hallelujah Mountains for Minetest

AKA Cloudlands — giant rocks floating suspended in magnetic eddies.

This can be run with or without a normal terrain mapgen, allowing pure skylands or an exotic addition to the landscape.

Configurable settings include the altitude islands appear, and the ability to restrict the areas they spawn.

It's a single file with no hard dependencies for easy integration into modpacks or games, e.g. as an exotic biome. 

Hallelujah Mountains [maps](https://i.imgur.com/2SkoAyB.png) can be generated by [Amidstest](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=19869), provided you know the seed of the world. The islands are not homogenous — there will be areas without any, while smaller islands tend to follow eddy fields, often emanating out from much larger and rarer islands.

**Mod dependencies:** None. 

**Minetest version:** v5.0+

**Recommended mods:**
* Vines, or something that contains vines, such as plantlife_modpack or MineClone2. These will grow off the sides of the islands, climate permitting, allowing you to climb, and looking picturesque!
* Extra ways to explore
    * [Bridger](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=18243) or [Bridges](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=3488) if you want to build nice wooden bridges between islands
    * [Airboat](https://github.com/paramat/airboat) to sail the high clouds on a small airship
    * [Flying carpet](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=12263)
    * [Jetpack, wings, etc.](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=11257)
    * Teleporter mods, balloon mods, etc.

**Ores tip:** If you want ores like iron and diamond to be obtainable from island stone, and are playing Minetest Game, you can go into Settings->Advanced Settings->Mods->cloudlands, set the "Altitude of Islands" to be 1300 (or higher), and Enable "Generate ores inside islands". This works because Minetest Game generates the ores in stone above 1025 to ensure they can be found in the mgV7 Floatlands. Ores can be added in other games or at other altitudes by adding adjusted copies of the game's calls to minetest.register_ore().
