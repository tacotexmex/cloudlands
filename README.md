# Hallelujah Mountains for Minetest

AKA Cloudlands â€” giant rocks floating suspended in magnetic eddies.

This can be run with or without a normal terrain mapgen, allowing pure skylands or an exotic addition to the landscape.

Configurable settings include the altitude islands appear, and the ability to restrict the area they spawn.

It's a single file with no hard dependencies for easy integration into modpacks or games, e.g. as an exotic biome. 

**Mod dependencies:** None. 

**Minetest version:** 0.5.x

**Recommended mods:**
* Vines, or something that contains vines, such as plantlife_modpack or MineClone2. These will grow off the sides of the islands, climate permitting, allowing you to climb, and looking picturesque!
* [Bridger](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=18243) if you want to build nice wooden bridges between islands
